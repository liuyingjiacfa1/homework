# Data_Skills_F2019_assignment_1

DUE DATE: On GitHub Classroom no later than Monday, October 14th before midnight.

Congratulations on your new position as a research assistant!  The team is very excited to have you, particularly since you are the only person who knows any Python.  The last person who knew a little quit suddenly, and no one knows how to read the code they wrote.  For that matter, the person you've replaced didn't really KNOW Python either, per se; there might have been a free online course involved or something.  We all prefer to write code in Stata here, am I right??

It's fortunate that you're here to rescue us, since there was a small project in Python that last person wrote that needs to be revived.  Originally it was going to be a one-off thing, so we didn't put much thought into it at the time.  Now we'll probably need to re-run this code a lot every few months.

In fact we're pretty sure the project will need to be expaned soon, so we'll keep you posted.  In the mean time, if you could just read up on the code and clean it up and such, that would be great.  Take this week with it.  Thanks!

-Management

  * Read and understand the project
  * Refactor the code so that it is nicely organized and uses Python style
  * Functions!
  * Use what we've discussed this quarter and last about what good functions look like
  * Eliminate as many bad practices as you can find
  * In the end make sure it generates the same two graphs
  * Think about other people having to read the code, you having to use the code yourself months after you write it, and keeping the code clear to prevent unseen errors
  * IMPORTANT: This project involves downloading many smaller files.  In order to reduce how many times we all download it, the retrieved files are included in the repository.  Please modify the code right away to make downloading optional when it is run, and then use it responsibly.  If you were in PPHA 30550 in the spring, please refer to your lectures on web scraping.  If you were not in that class or are otherwise unclear, please ask.
